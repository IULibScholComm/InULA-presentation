"Non-Traditional Documents":

- Documents created by the **IU community** \\ that would **benefit from being published** \\ but are **not publishable by scholarly or commercial presses**. \\ This is because they may be:

    - not apt for peer review
    - too long, or too short
    - too esoteric
    - too costly to publish or not expected to sell
    - digital-first
        - dynamic media
        - interactivity

## How Do We Publish? Our Principles

- Diamond Open Access
- Author Retains Copyright
- Barrier-Free Publishing

![](images\oa_logo-trans.svg){.absolute right=20 width="20%"}

::: {.notes}
So here are some of our publishing values:

Our publishing service is Diamond Open Access, meaning unlike most scholarly and commercial presses, our publications cost readers nothing and they cost authors nothing to make them free to readers.

Moreover, unlike most scholarly and commercial presses, our authors retain their copyright, so they retain ownership of their work and can distribute and republish it elsewhere. 

Our publishing service is also free from most acceptance barriers, such as peer review and return on investment. This enables a broader range of documents to find an audience. \\ This also enables us to publish faster than traditional presses.

## Why Do We Publish These Documents This Way?

- Multiformat publishing improves access and accessibility
- Quarto is more affordable, sustainable, preservable, + data scientific
- Copyediting + design improves the product

:::{.notes}
We established this service for the following reasons. 

Previously, those who wanted to publish non-traditional documents could only deposit a pdf in our libraryâ€™s repository.
But while pdfs are great for printing / physical copies, they are limited in other areas: 

- they cannot handle dynamic or interactive media
- they are hard to read on different screen sizes, from cell phones to desktops
- they are not machine readable 
- their raw content is not accessible
- for impaired readers they are less accessible than ePubs

In sum, publishing as posting and hosting a pdf limits access and accessibility. 

Multiformat publishing--pdf, html, ePubs, raw content--however broadens access and accessibility and thus potential uses and readerships. We therefore wanted to enable multiformat publishing.

We're doing so with Quarto, rather than prominent publishing platforms such as PressBooks, to advocate platforms that are 

- free (free of all costs, including hosting costs)
- more sustainable (easy to maintain, small footprint, no database)
- easier to preserve (static, no database).
- apt for interactive data science

Lastly, offering copyediting and design help will improve the quality and appearance of the publication.
